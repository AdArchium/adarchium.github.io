    name: Area Denial Drop
    description: "Before the start of the first turn, when placing units into Reserve, a player must assign all models with this special rule in the army to Reserve to perform an Area Denial Drop. At the beginning of the controlling player's first turn, before any other models are moved or deployed, all of the Area Denial Drop units must enter play using the procedure described below: \n Performing an Area Denial Drop \n When deploying the Area Denial Drop, the controlling player selects one of the available units to deploy first. Place a single model from that unit anywhere on the battlefield that is at least 6\\" from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain and is outside of all Deployment Zones. Do not scatter the model. If possible, the model must be placed in a position that will allow any other models in the same unit to deploy (as follows), and may only be placed in a position that denies the remainder of the squad a place within unit coherency if no other position is available. \n Once the model's final position has been decided, the remainder of the unit may be deployed anywhere that is within unit coherency and more than 6\\" from any enemy model or piece of Impassable Terrain. Any models that cannot be placed are removed as casualties. \n Once this first unit has been deployed, roll a D6. On the roll of a '1', the Area Denial Drop is Disordered and the opposing player may deploy each remaining unit in the Area Denial Drop anywhere within 12\\" of the first unit without scattering, though no model may be within 1\\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. If the roll is a '2' or higher, the controlling player deploys each remaining unit anywhere within 12\\" of the first without scattering, though no model may be within 1\\" of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. \n Once all units are deployed, any enemy units within line of sight and range may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction (see page 309 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook) targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop. Any units that are chosen to make the Interceptor Reaction do not expend any of the controlling player's Reaction Allotment, but do count as having made a Reaction (and thus can React again before the next Phase begins). Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of an Area Denial Drop. \n Once all units from the Area Denial Drop have been deployed and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have been deployed as part of an Area Denial Drop may not Move or Run in the Movement phase of the turn in which they are deployed, but may Shoot and declare Charges as normal (if the models deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop are allowed to make Charges)."

    name: Barrage
    description: "All Barrage weapons use Blast markers and consequently use the rules for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions: \n Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their Minimum Range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6\\". If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its Minimum Range. \n Note that any Hits inflicted upon Vehicles by an Attack using the Barrage special rule are always resolved against the Vehicle’s Side Armour Value. \n Multiple Barrages \n If a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows: The Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier. Once the first marker is placed, roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below). If a Hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker). Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of Hits and roll To Wound for these Hits. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first Blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage. \n Apocalyptic Barrage \n An Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped Apocalyptic Barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it. Once the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the Apocalyptic Barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire Apocalyptic Barrage marker."

    name: Blast
    description: "When firing a Blast weapon, models do not roll To Hit. Instead, pick one enemy model visible to the firer and place the Blast (3\\") marker with its hole entirely over the base of the target model, or its hull if the target is a Vehicle. The hole at the centre of the marker must be within the weapon’s Maximum Range. You cannot place the Blast marker so that the base or hull of any friendly model is even partially under it.\n The large area affected by the blast means it is going to be very hard to miss completely. Nonetheless, the shot might not land exactly where intended. Roll for the Blast marker to scatter and subtract the firer’s Ballistic Skill from the distance (if any) that it scatters, to a minimum of 0\\". Note that it is possible, and absolutely fine, for a shot to scatter beyond the weapon’s Maximum or Minimum Range and line of sight. This represents the chance of ricochets, the missile blasting through cover and other random events. In these cases, Hits are worked out as normal and can hit and Wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the battlefield’s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded.\n Once the final position of the Blast marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above – each unit suffers one Hit for each of the models included in that unit that is fully or partially beneath the Blast marker, even if those models are not within the firer’s line of sight.\n Once the number of Hits inflicted on the unit has been worked out, roll To Wound and Save as normal. Note that, unlike other attacks, Wounds inflicted by an attack with the Blast special rule can be allocated to any models in the target unit, even if they are out of sight of any models from the attacking unit.\n Multiple Blasts\n If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described above and determine how many Hits are scored with each individual Blast marker. After the last shot, add up the total number of Hits scored and roll all of the To Wound rolls as normal.\n Blast Weapons and Re-rolls\n If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a Blast weapon, the player must re-roll both the Scatter dice and the 2D6. Note that this applies only to models able to fully re-roll a To Hit roll, not to models that may re-roll To Hit rolls of a specific value – for example, models that can re-roll To Hit rolls of a ‘1’ cannot re-roll either the Scatter dice or 2D6 unless another rule allows them to do so.\n Blast Weapons and Snap Shots\n Blast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.\n Large Blast\n Large Blast weapons use the 5\\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n Massive Blast\n Massive Blast weapons use the 7\\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n Apocalyptic Blast\n Apocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10\\" Blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.\n Apocalyptic Mega-blast (5\\"/7\\"/10\\")\n Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons use the Apocalyptic Blast marker. They obey the rules for Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:\n Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons have three Strength values and three AP values. Correspondingly, the Apocalyptic Blast marker is divided into three zones, as shown in the diagram on the next page, one for each Strength and AP value.\n The Strength and AP of any Hits depends on the zone in which the target model is located. The first Strength and AP value are used for the inner zone, the second Strength and AP value are used for the middle zone, and the third Strength and AP value are used for the outer zone. Always use the best Strength and AP if a model straddles two or more zones. If a unit has models in several zones, work out the Hits inflicted for each zone separately. Note that there will be a different Wound Pool for each zone.\n To determine whether a unit wounded by an Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapon is allowed a Cover Save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the Apocalyptic Blast marker, instead of from the firing model.\n Hits from Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons made against Vehicles are always resolved against their Side Armour Value."

    description: "A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule that is locked in combat can choose to leave close combat at the end of any Assault phase. If the unit wishes to do so, it must take an Initiative test. \n If the Test is failed, nothing happens and the models remain locked in the fight. \n If the Test is passed, choose a direction – then roll 2D6 and add the unit’s Movement Characteristic to the result. As long as the distance rolled, in inches, is sufficient to allow the entire unit to move over 1\\" away from all of the enemy units they are locked in combat with, the unit breaks away from combat and must immediately move a number of inches in the chosen direction equal to the 2D6 + Movement result, ignoring the models they were locked in combat with. No Sweeping Advance rolls are made. Enemy units that are no longer locked in combat immediately Consolidate a number of inches equal to their Initiative. \n A Hit & Run Move is not slowed by Difficult Terrain, but does trigger Dangerous Terrain tests as normal. It may not be used to move into base or hull contact with enemy units, and models instead stop 1\\" away. If there are units with this rule on both sides who wish to disengage, roll off to determine who goes first and then alternate disengaging them. If the last of these ends up no longer in combat, it Consolidates instead."

    description: "Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multi-character unit.\n Joining and Leaving a Unit\n An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.\n In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.\n An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.\n An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase.\n While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.\n Special Rules\n When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.\n Independent Characters and Infiltrate\n An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.\n Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.\n Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared."

    description: "If a non-Vehicle unit suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from a weapon with the Pinning special rule, it must take a Leadership test once the firing unit has finished its Shooting Attacks for that Phase. This is called a Pinning test. If the unit fails the Test, it is Pinned. As long as the Test is passed, a unit can be called upon to take multiple Pinning tests in a single turn, but only once for each unit shooting at them.\n A unit that is affected by any of the following conditions does not take Pinning tests, and if called upon to do so is considered to automatically pass them:\n • The unit is locked in combat.\n • The unit is already Pinned (the unit remains Pinned, but takes no further Tests).\n • The unit is composed entirely of Vehicle models.\n • The unit is Embarked on a Transport Vehicle.\n • The target unit is affected by the Fearless special rule.\n A unit that has become Pinned cannot Move, Run or Charge. It can only fire Snap Shots if it attacks during the Shooting phase and cannot make Reactions in any Phase. At the end of its following turn, the unit returns to normal and the unit is free to act as normal from then on. Whilst it is Pinned, a unit is affected normally by enemy actions (for example, it takes Morale checks as normal). If the unit is forced to move, for example if it has to Fall Back, it returns to normal immediately. If assaulted, the unit will fight as usual, but because they are not set to receive the Charge, enemy units do not receive the Initiative penalty for assaulting a unit in Difficult Terrain (see page 222), even if the unit is in Difficult Terrain. If a unit becomes Pinned during a Charge, then that Charge automatically fails. Units that are locked in combat cannot be Pinned and do not take Pinning tests."
