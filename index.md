<i>Ad Archium</i> (IE: <i>To the Archive</i> in M3.English) is a free reference retrevial <strong>tool</strong>, made by the community, for the community. 

Our goal is simple: allow players to quickly and accurately cross-check references during gameplay. 

Visitors to <i>Ad Archium</i> should consider it as an <strong>extension</strong> of their reference material, <strong>NOT</strong> a replacement for them. 
In keeping with the above goal, we will <strong>never</strong> publish army construction metrics of any kinds (organization charts, unit composition/options/points, etc).
Please support all official releases and their respective authors.

Sincerely,<br />
The Scribes of the Gamma Leonis Cluster
