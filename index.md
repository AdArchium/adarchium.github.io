<h2 style="text-align:center;">A Warm Welcome, <br />Rememberancers &amp; Generals Alike ...</h2>

<i>Ad Archium</i> (IE: <i>To the Archive</i> in M3.English) is a reference retrevial <strong>tool</strong>, made by the community, for the community. 

Our goal is simple: allow players to quickly and accurately cross-check references during gameplay. 

Visitors to the Archive should consider <i>Ad Archium</i> as an extension of your reference material, <strong>NOT</strong> a replacement for them. 
In keeping with our goal, we will <strong>never</strong> publish army construction metrics of any kinds (organization charts, unit composition/options/points, etc).

Sincerely,<br />
The Scribes of the Gamma Leonis Cluster
