A Glossaric Archive for the Heretical War

## Description
_Ad Archium_ (IE: _To the Archive_ in M3.English) is a free reference retrevial **tool**, made by the community, for the community. 

Our goal is simple: allow players to quickly and accurately cross-check references during gameplay. 

Visitors to _Ad Archium_ should consider it as an **extension** of their reference material, **NOT** a replacement for them. In keeping with the above goal, we will **never** publish army construction metrics of any kinds (organization charts, unit composition/options/points, etc). 

**Please support all official releases and their respective authors.**

Please report any issues, bugs, and/or feature requests to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdArchium/adarchium.github.io/issues).
